# Not a Bomb Controller

So, the relay board with 433 RX and TX modules are installed in the basement, and a pi zero w was installed in the attic.

## Functionality

The attic has no problem communicating to the basement.  This is because the antennas are orriented in the same directions.  The basement pi is basically directly under the attic pi, and the attic pi RX antenna is a straigh uncoiled vertical antenna.  I also built a portable pi, which is really for another location, but, when offset from the attic antenna, RX worked fine.
